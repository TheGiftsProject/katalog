POST:
   * Default code format recognition in the server.
   * Emoji autocomplete.
   * Edit post.
   * MD preview should be the same preview as the final result (maybe by server request?).
   * Threads (1-level nesting?).
    
PROJECT:
   * Allows creating initial post with status (for older projects).

ACTIVITY FEED:
   * Should be the default page. Should have a 'pill' at the top of the index page as well.
   * Create a page with recent posts / new projects.

ZEN PAGE:
   * Do not limit to 5. More randomness. Titles!

GENERAL UI:
   * Mobile UI (bootstrap-responsive messes things up). Lacking index/show page mostly.
   * Projects with new posts should be bumped to top of index / have a 'UPDATED' tag.
   * Add ellipsis to project title/subtitle in index page.
   * Prevent from posting new posts or submitting project if empty fields (title/subtitle/post itself) by disabling button.
   * Repo and demo url links should be side by side and not one under the other.

BUGS:
   * Fix header buttons padding in Project show page - only in production.
   * Status updates filtering should be moved back under the image
