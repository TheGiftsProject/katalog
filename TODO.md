 * n+1 fixes. complete mess there.
 * Add authorization for everything related to project controller (don't allow edit if not contributor etc).
 * Check organizations/projects/users scopes throughout controllers and support.
 * Error pages work? (also when not in organization scope - 404, rescue from record not found). I18n for errors.
 * What happens when Github organization is deleted? Merge users organization with existing one (only when changing organization).
