BUGS:
 * Last commit does not update a project (Github hooks problem?).

PROJECT PAGE:
 * Allow to change status not only with post. 
 * Allow to change image not only by post.
 * Add project name to title **Hubot @ Katalog**
 * Add a nice page like UI for github pages (readme, todo ...). Currently their transition is too violent and the backround is wrong.
 * Don't show icons of TODO/Readme etc if not exist.
 * Hey "X", what's up with project X? (if no update for a 2-weeks?).

POST:
   * Default code format recognition in the server.
   * Emoji autocomplete.
   * MD preview should be the same preview as the final result (maybe by server request?).
   * Edit post.

ZEN PAGE:
   * Better. More random? Only recent? With people? UGH.
