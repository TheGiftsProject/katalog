POST:
    * Default code format recognition in the server.
    * Emoji autocomplete.
    * Edit post.
    * MD preview should be the same preview as the final result (maybe by server request?).
    
PROJECT:
   * Allows creating initial post with status (for older projects).

ACTIVITY FEED:
    * Should be the default page. Should have a 'pill' at the top of the index page as well.
    * Create a page with recent posts / new projects.

UI:
    * Mobile UI.
    * Projects with new posts should be bumped to top of index / have a 'UPDATED' tag.
    * Add elipssis to project title/subtitle in index page.
    * Prevent from posting new posts or submitting project if empty fields (title/subtitle/post itself) by disabling button.
    * Repo and demo url links should be side by side and not one under the other.

BUGS:
    * Fix header buttons padding in Project show page - only in production.
    * Status updates filtering should be moved back under the image.
