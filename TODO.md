BUGS:
 * Sometimes project duplicates are created. Also cannot destroy the duplicated.

GITHUB BUGS:
 * Last commit does not update a project (Github hooks problem?).
 * Updating repo doesn't update committers as contributors.

PROJECT PAGE:
 * Allow to change status not only with post. 
 * Allow to change image not only by post.
 * Add project name to title **Hubot @ Katalog**
 * Add a nice page like UI for github pages (readme, todo ...). Currently their transition is too violent and the backround is wrong.
 * Don't show icons of TODO/Readme etc if not exist.
 * Hey "X", what's up with project X? (if no update for a 2-weeks?).
 * Submit screenshot without having it to be in a post.
 * Add yourself as a user to a project manually ("I CONTRIBUTED TO THIS").
 * Don't add yourself as a contributor if you post.
 * Add "did you start working on it already?" after creating a project.

POST:
   * Default code format recognition in the server.
   * Emoji autocomplete.
   * MD preview should be the same preview as the final result (maybe by server request?).
   * Edit post.
