__PIPELINE:__
 * Fix long contributors list (limit to 3-4 and limit title).
 * Autocomplete should find users as well.
 * Don't show `I'm a contributor` if you already are.
 * Bump should redirect to Recents.
 * Add "did you start working on it already?" after creating a project.

GITHUB BUGS:
 * Last commit does not update a project (Github hooks problem?).
 * Updating repo doesn't update committers as contributors (works on creation).
 * Currently invalid repos (for users outside the organization) makes the Github syncer throw exceptions. They are rescued and nothing happens.

PROJECT PAGE:
 * Allow to change status not only with post.
 * Allow to change image not only by post.
 * Add project name to title **Hubot @ Katalog**
 * Hey "X", what's up with project X? (if no update for a 2-weeks?).

TODO/README/CHANGELOG PAGES:
 * Don't show icons of TODO/Readme etc if not exist.
 * Add a nice page like UI for github pages (readme, todo ...). Currently their transition is too violent and the backround is wrong.
 * `Back` link should redirect to project page, not to `All projects`.

POST:
   * Default code format recognition in the server.
   * Emoji autocomplete.
   * MD preview should be the same preview as the final result (maybe by server request?).
   * Edit post.
